=== 0.1.0 / 2008-05-19

* Important changes
  * Taglog now does ANDing logic rather than ORing
This is really how it should have been to begin with. I just noobed it up is all.

In version 0.0.1 if you did Dir.taglob('**/*.rb','foo','bar') it would select files as long they contained one of the tags(foo OR bar). In version 0.1.0 it will only select files which contain both tags(foo AND bar).

=== 0.0.1 / 2008-05-14

* Taglob "released"

  * Drew bugged me enough to finish the specs
